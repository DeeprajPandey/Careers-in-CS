# Careers in Computer Science
Website created for the fulfillment of project requirements of SA2, grade 10, 2014-15.

The website contains information on the career choices available to students who wish to pursue Computer Science. It also features an article written by me on Geek culture and the technology sector sweeping over the world economy, providing the most number of jobs.
