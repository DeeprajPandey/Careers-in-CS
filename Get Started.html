             <h4 class="header col s12 light">WHAT IS COMPUTER SCIENCE (CS)?</h4>
              <p class="light flow-text">CS teaches one how to think more methodically and how to solve problems more effectively. As such, its lessons are applicable well beyond the boundaries of CS itself.
But CS is also, more generally, the study of information. How do you represent it? With what methods (aka algorithms) can you process it?
              Perhaps the most liberal answer, though, is that CS “has no exclusive domain of its own, and that its importance comes from the problems to which it is applied.” And therein lies the excitement. CS empowers you with tools and ideas that can be applied to practically any domain of interest to you, both in college and beyond.</p>

           <div class="section">
             <h4 class="header col s12 light">WHAT IS CS... NOT?</h4>
              <p class="light flow-text">Contrary to popular belief, CS is not really about programming, even though you do learn how to program. Programming languages are tools that Computer Scientists use or create in order to solve problems of interest to them.</p>
           </div>
           <div class="section"> 
             <h4 class="header col s12 light">WHY STUDY CS?</h4>
              <p class="light flow-text">Computer science is part of a dynamic hub that links to fields such as electrical engineering, physics, chemistry, and biology, and to professions such as medicine and business.</p>
              <p class="light flow-text">In comparison to most academic disciplines, computer science is an unusual field. It was the early 1900s that the first computers, unbelievably primitive by today's standards, were developed, and it took another 25 years for computer science to become established as an independent discipline.</p>
              <p class="light flow-text">In the last quarter of a century, progress in computer science has been enormously rapid, and computers have had a profoundly transforming impact on society. Computer science research has provided much of the intellectual underpinning and creative energy that have fueled that transformation, and it continues to be an extremely exciting field.</p>
              <p class="light flow-text">You could see the field as the “planning and building” that fosters the sciences and engineering and informs our digital society. The computer industry - in fact, every part of our society and every type of business - needs a generation of skilled individuals who possess a new way of thinking, a new way of approaching research, and a new way of doing business.</p>
              <p class="light flow-text">That means...</p>
                <ul class="lighT flow-text">
                   <li>> deploying digital sensors to monitor everything from earthquakes to heartbeats</li>
                   <li>> modeling the way the brain works or how global weather patterns develop</li>
                   <li>> mining the data from the Human Genome Project to tackle disease</li>
                   <li>> translating radio signals to understand the nature of distant planets and galaxies
                   <li>> creating algorithms that automate e-commerce and make buying and selling online a breeze</li>
                   <li>> applying technology to solve public issues ranging from e-voting to privacy and security to cyber law.</li>
                </ul>
           </div>
           <div class="section"> 
             <h4 class="header col s12 light">SHOULD I CONCENTRATE OR MINOR IN CS EVEN IF I DON'T WANT TO BE A PROGRAMMER?</h4>
              <p class="light flow-text">Yes! CS concentrators head off in all sorts of directions after graduating with a CS Course.</p>                </div>
            <div class="divider amber darken-3"></div>
           <div class="light flow-text">
             <h4 class="header col s12 light">WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH A DEGREE IN COMPUTER SCIENCE?</h4>
              <p class="light flow-text">Some computer science graduates have moved into industry (as programmers) or entered graduate programs (from applied sciences to medicine to law).</p>
              <p>Still others have pursued entrepreneurial/business routes, found a home in the evolving world of digital media, or used their computational skills to move into finance, banking, or health care.</p>
              <p>Put simply, computer science serves as an entryway into just about every scientific and business-related field, and increasingly acts as an accelerator for success in academia and industry.</p>
