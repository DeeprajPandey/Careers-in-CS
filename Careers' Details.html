                  <p>There was a time when Software Testing was considered a layman’s job with no required domain or technical skills. Anyone with
basic knowledge of computers could be employed as a Tester. The work allocation for testers was also very limited. The job has gained sinificance over time. Certifications are an important add-on for someone who wishes to be a software tester. Some certifications are as follows:
                      <ul>

                  <i><ul>
                      <li>> Good Packages and Returns: Equal or better packages are being offered to QA Analysts (Quality Assurance) these days in comparison to their developer peers. The reason for this is the varied kinds of projects in the market where primary focus is not on development but on maintenance and performance.</li><br>
                      <li>> Ample On-site Opportunities: as testing is a short-term activity covering Staged Deliveries, Bug Fixing, Re-Testing, User Acceptance Testing (UAT) etc. it’s easy to compensate. Testing done on-site also makes communication easier as there might be tests which require interaction with other technical groups and business experts usually present at on-site offices. And onsite locations might be exotic too.</li><br>
                      <li>> Lucrative Alternate Career: If you decide to take up the profile of a tester and should you decide this is not the line for you, there’s another lucrative role waiting in the wings for you – that of a Business Analyst or BA. The reason for this obvious career progression is the tester/QA analyst’s involvement in the end-to-end business process.</li>

                  Data analysts must be detail-oriented, mathematically inclined, and have the ability to work independently. Proficiency with computer systems, data management concepts, and database structures are also important. Strong writing skills are also a plus, since data analysts often have to prepare written summaries, company memos, or press releases. Familiarity with a particular market or industry is also valuable.

                  <p>Chip designing, or Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) design is a challenging job because of the constant innovation in process technology. In addition to its dynamic nature,
                      as products become increasingly complex these challenges must also be overcome. At its base lies Electronics Engineering and Computer Science and like others, this industry too, is not without its lore and legend.</p>

                  <div class="divider"></div>
                  The entire developer ecosystem can broadly be categorised into the demand side and the supply side. On the demand side, there are three kinds of entities:
                  <ul>
                      <li>> The gaming, publishing and content companies trying to develop their own offerings in the mobile space.</li>
                      <li>> People who are developing their own applications and porting those applications on to the different marketplaces.</li>
                      <li>> OPDs or Offshore Product Development companies that exploit the arbitrage opportunity that’s created in this space.</li>
                  </ul>
                  On the supply side, there are again three profiles for mobile developers:
                  <ul>
                      <li>> MIS developers, who are part of a large enterprise organisation whose concerns are compatibility, scalability & security</li>
                      <li>> Game developers, who work across platforms</li>
                      <li>> Web developers, who work in the mobile space and develop mobile web pages or Rich Internet Applications.</li>
                  </ul></p>
                  <p>Educational Requirements
                  <div class="divider"></div>
                  The people most suited for this field have a technical background. They could be:
                  <ul>
                      <li>> B.E. or B.Tech</li>
                      <li>> B.CA</li>

                  <p>What it takes to get into System Administration
                  <div class="divider"></div>
                  Experience is more important than anything else to get a job in system administration. Along with the degrees, Certifications seems to be lot more important while getting a job. There are several recognised certifications:
                  <ul>
                      <li>> MCSA (Microsoft Certified Solutions Associate) for System Admin/ System Engineer</li>
                      <li>> MCITP (Microsoft Certified IT Professional) for System Admin/ System Engineer</li>
                      <li>> CCNA (Cisco Certified Network Associate) for Network Admin/ Network Engineer</li>
                      <li>> CCNP (Cisco Certified Networking Professional) for Network Admin/ Network Engineer</li>
                      <li>> LPIC (Linux Professional Institute Certification 1, 2 and 3)</li>
                      <li>> RHCE (Red Hat Certified Engineer)</li>
                      <li>> HPASE (HP Accredited Systems Engineer)</li>
                      <li>> HPCSE (HP Certified Systems Engineer)</li>
                      <li>> OCP (Oracle Certfied Pofessional)</li>
                      <li>> OSA (Oracle System Administrator)</li>
                  </ul>
                  Most of these courses are Operating System-specific, which inherently implies that though the job of System Admins may be the same,
their specialisation is the lynchpin to their job (i.e. depending on the system that the company's server is built on).</p>

                  <div class="divider"></div>
            <i>Other than specialisation of the operating systems that run servers, system administrators also specialise in four main fields:
                  <ul>
                      <li>> Architects: System Architects lay out the system of a company from scratch – deciding the foundational operating system that everything would run on and the material required to ensure that things are set up smoothly and making sure that everything is ready before giving the go-ahead.</li><br>
                      <li>> Designers: System Designers work hand-in-hand with the System Architects. They help set up and design the system – right from the server to the individual PCs. They implement the ideas laid forth by the Architect.</li><br>
                      <li>> Engineers: The most well-known of System Admins. They’re the people who’re on hand whenever and wherever things need to be kept top notch, wherever any kind of updates are required. They’re the keepers of peace between user and interface. From the point when the system is set up,
they work to keep the machine well-oiled and running.</li><br>
                      <li>> Consultants: The druids of this little Gaulish village, the System Consultants are referred to whenever any of the others hit a wall in the process. They smoothen out the wrinkles and advise as and when required. They’re the troubleshooters to the troubleshooters. Usually, consultants are people who have several years (if not decades) of experience in the field of system management. These consultants are usually the best and brightest of their generation.</li><br>
