         Watch any Hollywood high-school drama and you’ll find geeks being portrayed as the weak downtrodden lot who
get trampled on by the jocks of the world. At least that’s how it used to be. Watch any modern-day coming-of-age
story and halfway down the movie, the once-bullied bespectacled bicycle riding nerd will be driving up in a sports car with a supermodel for arm
candy. He’s still a bespectacled nerd of course but what these movies are trying to show you here is that in the real world geeks, nerds or anyone who
builds their careers on technology (and primarily computers to be specific) will eventually hit it big.<br>
             
And it’s so obvious when you think about it. Just about every business today relies on an IT backbone not just to thrive but even to survive. At a
very pedestrian level even a company that fulfils simple packaging orders for vendors relies on email, computers and telephones to service its clients.
And chances are, there are IT professionals who make it all function the way it should.<br>
             
The gamut of careers one can look at in the technology sector doesn’t just extend to the very basic example I gave above. There are specialised areas
such as VLSI and Chip Design, Software Testing, Information Security and literally dozens of others. In fact as per a study published by US News &
World Report, covering the The 100 Best Jobs of 2014, 5 of the top 10 were in Technology (The other five were in Healthcare).<br>
             
Over the years, there are quite a few technology careers which were in demand in the past and are still hot and sought after. While
a few nitty gritties such as the certifications, pay scales and technical skills required have changed, at their core they’re still the same and very much in demand. With this thought in mind we’ve come up with this compendium of tech careers in the form of a Website.<br>
             
While compiling it, we’ve tried to update all the information to the current landscape. And we’re hoping it will give young people such as yourself
a glimpse into what it’s like to build a career in the technology sector.<br>
             
             Good luck on your endeavours!<br><br>
